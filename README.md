# robust-tube-mpc
This repository now includes the basic MPC and disturbance-invariant MPC (explaind in Langson 2004). 
I am planning to add Tube-MPC(Mayne 2005) soon and Homothetic Tube-MPC(Rakovic 2012) in few months.
At the current stage, the code is messy because it is my first time to define a class from scratch and to study model predictive control, but of course, it will be fixed later!
